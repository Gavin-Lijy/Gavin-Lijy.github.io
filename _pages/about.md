I'm Jingyu Li, English name Gavin. I graduated from Zhejiang University of China in 2022, and now a research assistant in Cambridge, supervised by Dr. [Ricard Argelaguet](https://rargelaguet.github.io/) and Prof. [Wolf Reik](https://www.babraham.ac.uk/our-research/epigenetics/wolf-reik).  My interests lie in developing and applying single-cell multi-omics methods to decode epigenetic regulation in cell fate decision. 

During my undergraduate, I got the enlightment of single cell biology from Prof. [Guoji Guo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TJmA1AMAAAAJ&hl=en), and started to utilise deep learning models to predict gene regulation and cell fate decisions. With the deepening of research and the exploration in different directions, I increasingly realised the significance of single-cell multi-omics to address these questions, and the miraculous epigenetic mechanisms underlying, which was exactly why I chose to join my current lab. Please see my [CV](https://gavin-lijy.github.io/assets/pdf/CV_gavin.pdf) for more information.
