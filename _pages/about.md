I'm Jingyu Li, English name Gavin. I graduated from Zhejiang University of China in 2022, and now a research assistant in Cambridge supervised by Dr. [Ricard Argelaguet](https://rargelaguet.github.io/) and Prof. [Wolf Reik](https://www.babraham.ac.uk/our-research/epigenetics/wolf-reik).  



I'm developing and applying single-cell multi-omics methods to decode epigenetic regulation in cell fate decision.
