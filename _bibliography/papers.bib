  abstract = {Despite extensive efforts to generate and analyze reference genomes, genetic models to predict gene regulation and cell fate decisions are lacking for most species. Here, we generated whole-body single-cell transcriptomic landscapes of zebrafish, Drosophila and earthworm. We then integrated cell landscapes from eight representative metazoan species to study gene regulation across evolution. Using these uniformly constructed cross-species landscapes, we developed a deep-learning-based strategy, Nvwa, to predict gene expression and identify regulatory sequences at the single-cell level. We systematically compared cell-type-specific transcription factors to reveal conserved genetic regulation in vertebrates and invertebrates. Our work provides a valuable resource and offers a new strategy for studying regulatory grammar in diverse biological systems.},

  abstract = {Following gastrulation, the three primary germ layers develop into the major organs in a process known as organogenesis. Single-cell RNA sequencing has enabled the profiling of the gene expression dynamics of these cell fate decisions, yet a comprehensive map of the interplay between transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements is lacking, as are the underlying gene regulatory networks. Here we generate a multi-omics atlas of mouse early organogenesis by simultaneously profiling gene expression and chromatin accessibility from tens of thousands of single cells. We develop a computational method to leverage the multi-modal readouts to predict transcription factor binding events in cis-regulatory elements, which we then use to infer gene regulatory networks that underpin lineage commitment events. Finally, we show that these models can be used to generate in silico predictions of the effect of transcription factor perturbations. We validate this experimentally by showing that Brachyury is essential for the differentiation of neuromesodermal progenitors to somitic mesoderm fate by priming cis-regulatory elements.},
